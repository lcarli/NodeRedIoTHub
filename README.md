# @nodecolor/node-red-contrib-azure-iot-hub

Security patch and update for "node-red-contrib-azure-iot-hub" see https://github.com/lcarli/NodeRedIoTHub

node-red-contrib-azure-iot-hub is a <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node that allows you to send messages and register devices with Azure IoT Hub. This is a fork from the original Node-RED example by the Azure IoT team found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/node/device/node-red).

It contains a total of four Node-RED cloud nodes: **Azure IoT Hub**, **Azure IoT Registry**, **Azure IoT Hub Receiver** and **Azure IoT Hub Device Twin**

#### Azure IoT Hub

This node allows you to send messages to your Azure IoT Hub.  It has the following payload format:
```
{
  "deviceId": "testenode1",
  "key": "cw3nniq77BbjpOCDLqb7xEFTU509HeR6Ki1NwR20jj0=",
  "protocol": "amqp",
  "data": "{tem: 25, wind: 20}"
}
```
- deviceId is your device's unique id.
- key is your device's primary or secondary key.
- protocol options are: amqp, amqpws, mqtt or http.
- data can either be a plain string or string wrapped JSON.

#### Azure IoT Registry

This node allows you to registers devices with your Azure IoT Hub. It has the following payload format:

```
{
  "deviceId": "testenode1"
}
```

#### Azure IoT Hub Receiver

This is a simple node for receiving device-to-cloud messages via default Azure Events Hub endpoint. It does not require a payload.


#### Azure IoT Hub Device Twin

This is a simple node to retrieve Azure IoT Hub Device Twin(s). It has the following optional payload format:

```
"deviceId123"
```
- The optional payload can be the device Id in string format
- If this property type is not defined or is not a string, all Device Twins are retrieved
- Each input will produce an output with either ```msg.error``` as error object or ```msg.payload``` as an array of Device Twin data.


## Installation

```
npm install -g node-red-contrib-azure-iot-hub
```
